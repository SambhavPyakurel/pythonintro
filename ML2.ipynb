    "- Reducing the number of parameters: Use smaller neural networks, fewer features\n",
    "- Regularization: Add penalties for complex models.\n",

    "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. It involves adding a penalty for model complexity to the optimization objective. This discourages the model from learning the noise or outliers in the training data and encourages more generalized predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common regularization techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 regularization - Also called Laplace regularization or lasso regression. It applies an L1 norm penalty which constrains the sum of the absolute values of the parameters. This has the effect of driving some parameters to exactly zero, sparsely selecting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 regularization - Also called ridge regression. It applies an L2 norm penalty which constrains the sum of the squared values of the parameters. This shrinks large parameter values but does not set any to zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dropout - A regularization technique for neural networks where randomly selected nodes are ignored during training. This prevents the nodes from co-adapting too much. At inference time, all nodes are used but their weights are scaled down based on the dropout rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data augmentation - Techniques to synthetically generate more similar training examples. This makes the model more robust to minor variations in the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Early stopping - Stopping model training before overfitting based on the validation loss. The validation loss typically starts increasing after an optimal number of epochs as the model begins to overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "How they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that depends on the model complexity. This forces the optimizer to find a balance between minimizing the training error and minimizing the model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a model that generalizes better to new data by avoiding fitting the noise in the training data too closely. Regularization effectively reduces the variance of the model, trading off some increase in bias for a better overall performance.\n",
