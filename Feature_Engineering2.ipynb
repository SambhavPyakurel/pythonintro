    "\n",

    "Embedded feature selection methods are techniques that select features during the model training process. Some common embedded feature selection techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- L1 regularization: This uses L1 norm regularization (also known as Lasso regularization) in techniques like linear regression or logistic regression. The L1 norm penalty causes some of the coefficient weights to become exactly zero, effectively removing those features. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forests: When training a random forest, we can calculate the feature importance scores for each feature based on how often that feature is used in the decision trees. Less important features will have lower importance scores and can be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient Boosting: Similarly to random forests, gradient boosting models can also calculate feature importance scores which can be used to select important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Networks: During training of a neural network, the weights connecting input features to the first hidden layer become very small for less important features. These features with small weights can be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees: Decision trees inherently perform feature selection by selecting the most important features to split on at each node. The features that are rarely or never used for splitting can be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This is an iterative process where we train a model, identify the least important feature, remove that feature, and retrain the model. This is repeated until a desired number of features remain."

    "Here are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It does not consider feature dependencies. The Filter method scores each feature independently based on its correlation with the target variable. It does not account for dependencies and interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It does not consider final model performance. The features are selected based only on their individual scores, not how well they will perform within the final model. This can lead to a suboptimal feature subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It may exclude useful features. Features that are only useful when combined with other features may be excluded since the Filter method looks at features individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is sensitive to outliers and data anomalies. The feature scores can be skewed if the data has outliers or anomalies, leading to suboptimal feature selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. It does not generalize well. The feature scores are calculated based on the training data, but may not generalize well to new unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Redundant features may be retained. Features that are highly correlated with each other may both be retained since the Filter method does not consider feature dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Thresholding can be arbitrary. Setting a threshold on the feature scores to determine how many features to retain can be arbitrary and affect the results."

    "Here are a few situations where the Filter method may be preferred over the Wrapper method for feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Speed - If speed is the primary concern and you need to quickly select a preliminary set of features, the Filter method is much faster since it does not require training multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Interpretability - The Filter method provides more interpretable feature scores based on statistical metrics. The Wrapper method is more of a 'black box' approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Large number of features - For datasets with a very large number of features, the Wrapper method can become prohibitively slow since it has to train models on all possible feature subsets. The Filter method can scale better in this scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Initial exploratory analysis - The Filter method is useful as an initial pass to narrow down the number of features before applying more complex Wrapper or Embedded methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simple models - If you plan to use a simple model like linear regression or logistic regression, the Filter method may work almost as well as the Wrapper method at selecting good features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Limited computational resources - If you have constraints on processing power or memory, the Filter method can be preferred due to its lower computational requirements compared to the Wrapper method."
