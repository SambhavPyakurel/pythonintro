    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are two techniques for converting categorical variables into numeric values. The main differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding preserves the ordering of categories if there is a natural ordering. It assigns integers starting from 0 in order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Label Encoding simply assigns a unique integer to each category. It does not preserve any ordering of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "Let's say we have a column with fruit names:\n",

    "|Category|\n",
    "|--|\n",
    "|Apple|    \n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where you encode the categorical variables in a way that maximizes the separation between classes in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split your data into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fit an ordinal encoding on the training set categories. This converts each category to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Train a simple classifier (like logistic regression) on the training set using the ordinally encoded features. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each category of each feature, calculate the difference in weighted mean target values between adjacent ordinally encoded values. The weighted mean is calculated using the predictions from the trained classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reorder the encoded values of each feature's categories so that the adjacent encoded values have the largest difference in weighted mean target values. This maximizes the separation between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Refit the ordinal encoder on the training set with the reordered categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Apply the  same encoding to the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Train your actual model on the transformed training data using the target guided encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have categorical features that you suspect may be correlated with your target variable, but you don't know the exact ordering of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The categories have no inherent natural ordering. Ordinal Encoding cannot be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The categories are not equally correlated with the target. Some categories may have a stronger influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a dataset of customer purchase records, with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer location (NY, LA, Chicago, Miami)\n",
    "- Product category (Books, Electronics, Apparel, Food)\n",
    "- Purchase amount ($)\n",
    "\n",
    "And the target variable is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High value customer (yes, no)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the customer location and product category features are categorical with no inherent ordering. But some locations and product categories may be more indicative of high value customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can train a simple model on the training set that tries to predict the target based only on the categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We calculate the weighted mean target value for each category (based on the model's predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We reorder the encodings so that categories with higher weighted mean target values get lower encoded values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "Location:    \n",
    "\n",
    "NY -> 0    \n",
    "LA -> 1\n",
    "Miami -> 2  \n",
    "Chicago -> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Product:\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronics -> 0     \n",
    "Apparel -> 1\n",
    "Books -> 2\n",
    "Food -> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Because customers in NY and purchasing Electronics have the highest correlation with being a high value customer, they get the lowest encoded values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then train our actual model using this encoding, which may improve its ability to identify high value customers."
