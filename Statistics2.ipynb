    "1. Range: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It gives an idea of the total spread or extent of the data. e.g.  let's consider a dataset of ages: 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45. The range would be 45 - 25 = 20, indicating that the ages range from 25 to 45.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance is a more robust measure of dispersion that takes into account the spread of all values in a dataset. It measures the average squared deviation of each value from the mean. A higher variance indicates a greater spread of data points. e.g. let's consider a dataset of ages: 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45. The mean would be (25 + 30 + 35 + 40 + 45) / 5 = 35. The variance would be [(25-35)^2 + (30-35)^2 + (35-35)^2 + (40-35)^2 + (45-35)^2] / 5 = 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It is widely used because it represents the spread of data in the same unit as the original data. The standard deviation provides a measure of how much individual values typically deviate from the mean.  let's consider a dataset of ages: 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45. the standard deviation would be √50 ≈ 7.07."
